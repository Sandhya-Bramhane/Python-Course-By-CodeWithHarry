different files. Place these files in a folder for a 13 â€“ year old'''

'''Summary
Define a function to create a multiplication table.
Use a loop to generate each line of the table.
Write the table to a file.
Call the function for each number from 2 to 20.'''


'''This will create files table_2, table_3, ..., table_20 in a folder named table, each containing the multiplication table for the corresponding number.'''

'''Function: A block of code designed to perform a specific task.
String: A sequence of characters, like "Hello" or "2 X 1 = 2".
For Loop: A way to repeat a block of code multiple times.
File Handling: Opening a file, writing to it, and then closing it.'''
