Encapsulation in Python is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP). It involves bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit known as a class. 
Key aspects of encapsulation in Python:
Data hiding:Python
Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of an object's attributes and methods. This is achieved through the use of naming conventions:
Public members: Accessible from anywhere. No special naming convention is required.
Protected members: Accessible within the class and its subclasses. Prefixed with a single underscore (_).
Private members: Accessible only within the class. Prefixed with double underscores (__).
Controlled access:
Encapsulation allows you to control how data is accessed and modified through getter and setter methods. This ensures data integrity and prevents unintended changes.
Abstraction:
Encapsulation helps to hide the internal implementation details of a class from the outside world. This allows you to focus on the functionality of the class without needing to know how it works internally.
